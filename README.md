# golf-tee-time-bot
A Node bot which books tee times as soon as they become available.

Semi-obfuscated which course this is for because I'd prefer not to be banned from it.

## Usage
Define a `deploy.toml` with the desired config. See `config.toml` as an example.

Then build and deploy through Docker.
